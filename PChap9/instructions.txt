Add three methods to the Student class that compare twoStudent objects. One method (__eq__) should test for equality. A second method (__lt__) should test for less than. The third method (__ge__) should test for greater than or equal to. In each case, the method returns the result of the comparison of the two students’ names. Include a main function that tests all of the comparison operators.

The str method of the Bank class returns a string containing the accounts in random order. Design and implement a change that causes the accounts to be placed in the string by order of name. (Hint: You will also have to define some methods in the SavingsAccount class.)
